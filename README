Open Brain is a Python based set of tools for Neuronal data analysis and simulation.

Currently I am focused on the single unit spike train analysis. 

My next step would be multiple single unit spike trains and lfp data.

Installation notes:
I am developing on Snow Leopard, Python 2.6 
Originally I installed scipy and numpy and matplotlib using the super pack, but then I needed to try wxPython so I messed up all my Python installations so I straighten everything by installing python2.6 and py26-scipy and py26-matplotlib and py26-numpy using macports.
I use MaxOSX as the backend for matplotlib but any other backend should work.

I am adding MyBrain as a GUI to the OpenBrain, for now as wxPython has problems with Snow Leopard and Python 64bit I am using Tkinter but my plan is to switch to wxPython as it would give a lot more flexibility.

Basically my plan for MyBrain! is to make an Experiment Explorer in which user can see all the parameters in an experiment and select trials based on the conditions set on the parameters and then can do analysis or viualization on the selection or grouping.
